__Recursion__ 
Recursion refers to a method or a function that will call itself. It is used to resolve problems by breaking the problem down into sub-problems. 

#used when there is a problem that needs repetitive and complex solving in a program.
def exmaple(obj):
    //code logica

    return exmaple(obj)

Benefits of recursive:
Neat code 
Sub-problems
Easy sequences

Disadvantage:
Hard to follow
Memory
Debugging


#recursion if not used correctly can crash due to infinit looping.


__Divide and conquer__ 
This consists of two parts. The first is breaking the problem down into smaller sub-problems and the second is solving the final solution.

__Dynamic programming__ 
This is mainly used for optimization problems. It is similar to the divide and conquer algorithm in that it splits the problems into sub-problems.

__Greedy Algorithm__ 
This one finds the best solution in each and every step instead of approaching optimization in a global way.
